# Team6 - Soen6441


## Project Description

The project aims to develop a comprehensive Warzone game system, encompassing a map editor and gameplay functionalities. Users can create, edit, and validate custom maps while adhering to Warzone rules. The Map Editor module facilitates map creation, modification, and validation, while the Game Engine manages gameplay phases such as startup, reinforcement assignment, and order issuance. Through rigorous testing and adherence to coding conventions, the system ensures reliability and maintainability. With a modular architecture, it strives to provide a seamless gaming experience by integrating intuitive map editing tools with robust gameplay mechanics. This is a Java based Command Line implementation of popular "Risk" game, compatible with the rules and map files and the command-line play of the “Warzone” version of Risk, which can be found at: https://www.warzone.com/. The program was developed as requirement to complete Concordia University's course SOEN-6441 Advance Software Engineering and Practices.
